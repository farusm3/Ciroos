This JSON is a Grafana dashboard configuration designed for PetClinic Cross-Cluster Monitoring. It defines a visual dashboard with 6 panels, each showing metrics relevant to microservices deployed across clusters (C1 and C2). The data is typically sourced from Prometheus, using PromQL queries.

Let's go line-by-line and section-by-section to understand what's going on.

🧭 Root Level
{
  "dashboard": {


Defines the root dashboard object.

🏷️ Basic Metadata

📊 Panels Section
    "panels": [


Each item in this array is a panel — a graph, stat, or visualization. Let's walk through each panel.

🔍 Panel 1: Cross-Cluster Communication Health
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Cross-Cluster Communication Health",
        "type": "stat",


id – Unique panel ID.

title – Panel title shown on the dashboard.

type: stat – A single value visualization (big number).

        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "rate(http_requests_total{job=~\"visits.*\"}[5m])",
            "legendFormat": "Visits Service Request Rate"
          }
        ],


PromQL Query: Calculates the rate of HTTP requests to any job matching visits.* over 5 minutes.

legendFormat: Label for the stat.

        "fieldConfig": {
          "defaults": {
            "color": {
              "mode": "thresholds"
            },
            "thresholds": {
              "steps": [
                { "color": "green", "value": null },
                { "color": "red", "value": 0.1 }
              ]
            }
          }
        },


If value is < 0.1, panel turns red, else green (health threshold logic).

4	Memory Usage by Pod	Resource monitoring - memory
5	CPU Usage by Pod	Resource monitoring - CPU
6	Cross-Cluster Request Flow	Request rate across clusters for key services
