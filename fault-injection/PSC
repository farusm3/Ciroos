Sure! Let's go **line-by-line** and **explain every part** of this Python script for **complete beginners**, including all the little details, especially about **lists**, **dictionaries**, and other core concepts.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Script Summary

This is a **Python script** for **injecting faults** (bugs/errors) into a software system (specifically PetClinic) to test how it behaves under failure. This is common in **chaos engineering** â€” testing system robustness.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 1. Script Start and Metadata

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
PetClinic Fault Injection Script

This script injects various types of faults into the system to test monitoring and alerting capabilities.
"""
```

* `#!/usr/bin/env python3`: This is a **shebang** line that tells the operating system to use Python 3 to run this script.
* The `""" ... """` block is a **docstring** â€” a multiline string that serves as a comment to describe the script.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 2. Importing Modules (Libraries)

```python
import requests
import json
import time
import argparse
import sys
from typing import Dict, List
import subprocess
import os
```

These are all **Python modules**:

| Module       | What it does                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requests`   | Makes HTTP requests (like visiting websites or APIs).     |
| `json`       | Read/write data in JSON format (common config format).    |
| `time`       | Works with time: sleeping, current time, etc.             |
| `argparse`   | Handles command-line arguments.                           |
| `sys`        | Interacts with the system (e.g., exit the program).       |
| `typing`     | Used to annotate data types (`Dict`, `List`)              |
| `subprocess` | Runs system commands.                                     |
| `os`         | Interacts with the operating system (files, paths, etc.). |

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 3. Class Definition

```python
class FaultInjector:
```

* This creates a **class** â€” a blueprint for creating **objects**. Here, `FaultInjector` is a tool to inject and manage faults.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 4. Constructor Method

```python
def __init__(self, config_file: str = "../verification/config.json"):
```

* `__init__` is called automatically when a new object is created.
* `config_file: str` means the input must be a **string** (the path to the config file).
* `= "../verification/config.json"` is a **default value** if no argument is passed.

```python
with open(config_file, 'r') as f:
    self.config = json.load(f)
```

* `open(...)`: Opens a file for reading (`'r'`).
* `json.load(f)`: Parses JSON from the file into a **Python dictionary**.
* `self.config`: Stores this config in the object.

```python
self.injected_faults = []
```

* Creates an **empty list** to track injected faults.
* `List`: a collection type. For example: `[1, 2, 3]` or `["error", "warning"]`

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 5. List Available Faults

```python
def list_available_faults(self):
```

This method prints out the kinds of faults that can be injected.

```python
faults = [
    ("latency_injection", "Inject latency into C1 customers service"),
    ...
]
```

* `faults` is a **list of tuples**. Each tuple has:

  * a **fault ID** (like `"latency_injection"`)
  * a **description**

```python
for i, (fault_id, description) in enumerate(faults, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {fault_id}: {description}")
```

* `enumerate(..., 1)` gives you an index starting from 1.
* Each fault is printed.

Returns the list of faults.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 6. Inject Fault

```python
def inject_fault(self, fault_type: str, duration: int = 300):
```

* This injects a fault into the system.
* `fault_type`: string of which type of fault.
* `duration`: how long the fault should last (default is 300 seconds = 5 minutes).

```python
fault_methods = {
    "latency_injection": self._inject_latency_fault,
    ...
}
```

* A **dictionary** mapping fault type names to method calls.
* Dictionaries are key-value pairs: `{"key": "value"}`

Then it calls the correct function based on `fault_type`.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 7. Individual Fault Injection Methods

Each `_inject_xyz_fault()` method simulates a different fault:

### Example:

```python
def _inject_latency_fault(self, duration: int) -> bool:
```

* This adds **latency** (delay) to a service.
* The body just prints messages and simulates configuration updates.

```python
config_update = {
    "chaos.monkey.assaults.latency.active": "true",
    ...
}
```

* A **dictionary** simulating config updates.

```python
self._schedule_fault_removal("latency_injection", duration)
```

* This schedules the removal of the fault after a given time.

Other faults (like `_inject_memory_pressure`, `_inject_network_partition`) follow similar patterns.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 8. Schedule Fault Removal

```python
def _schedule_fault_removal(self, fault_type: str, duration: int):
```

* Waits for `duration` seconds then removes the fault.

```python
def remove_fault():
    time.sleep(duration)
    self.remove_fault(fault_type)
```

Uses `threading` to run in the background:

```python
import threading
thread = threading.Thread(target=remove_fault)
thread.daemon = True
thread.start()
```

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 9. Remove Fault

```python
def remove_fault(self, fault_type: str) -> bool:
```

* Based on the fault type, simulates "undoing" the fault.

```python
for fault in self.injected_faults:
    if fault["type"] == fault_type and fault["status"] == "active":
        fault["status"] = "removed"
        fault["end_time"] = time.time()
```

* Loops through the `injected_faults` list and marks the fault as removed.
* This shows how to **loop through a list of dictionaries**.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 10. List Active Faults

```python
def list_active_faults(self):
```

* Uses a list **comprehension**:

```python
active_faults = [f for f in self.injected_faults if f["status"] == "active"]
```

* This is a **filtered list** containing only active faults.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 11. Remove All Faults

```python
def remove_all_faults(self):
```

* Finds all active faults and removes each by calling `remove_fault(...)`.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 12. Generate Fault Report

```python
def generate_fault_report(self, output_file: str = "fault_report.json"):
```

Creates a JSON report:

```python
report = {
    "timestamp": time.time(),
    "total_faults": len(self.injected_faults),
    "active_faults": len([...]),
    "faults": self.injected_faults
}
```

* `len(...)` gets the number of items in a list.

Then saves this dictionary as a JSON file:

```python
with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(report, f, indent=2)
```

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 13. Main Function

```python
def main():
```

Handles **command-line arguments** using `argparse`.

```python
parser.add_argument("--inject", help="Inject a specific fault type")
```

* Each `add_argument()` defines a command-line flag.

```python
args = parser.parse_args()
```

* Reads all the flags passed to the script.

Then it checks which option was used:

```python
if args.list:
    injector.list_available_faults()
elif args.inject:
    ...
```

* Based on the flag, it calls the appropriate method.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 14. Script Entry Point

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This means: if this file is run as a script (not imported as a module), call the `main()` function.
