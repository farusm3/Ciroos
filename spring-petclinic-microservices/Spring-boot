A Spring Boot application is a standalone, production-ready Java application built using the Spring Boot framework. It simplifies Java development by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and starter dependencies to automate common configurations, allowing developers to build applications quickly and efficiently with minimal boilerplate code. Spring Boot is used to create web applications, REST APIs, and microservices, and it provides non-functional features like security, health checks, and externalized configuration out of the box.  
Key Features & Benefits
Auto-Configuration: Spring Boot analyzes your project and automatically configures necessary components, saving developers time and effort. 
Embedded Servers: It includes embedded servers (like Tomcat or Jetty) directly within the application, eliminating the need for separate deployment to an application server. 
Starter Dependencies: Curated bundles of libraries are provided through "starter" dependencies, simplifying the process of adding new functionalities and managing dependencies. 
Standalone & Production-Ready: Spring Boot applications are designed to be run independently and are production-ready from the start, requiring minimal configuration to get running. 
Convention over Configuration: It follows an "opinionated" approach by providing sensible defaults, simplifying setup and making it easy for developers to get started. 
Rapid Application Development: The streamlined setup, minimal configuration, and automated features enable developers to build and deploy applications quickly. 
Microservices & Web Applications: Spring Boot is a popular choice for developing both standalone microservices and complex web applications.
